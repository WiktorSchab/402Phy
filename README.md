Script usage:
Create a list (5 records) of dictionaries: Each dictionary in the list should represent a set of measurements, containing the following:
  - "U": Voltage (in Volts)
  - "I": Current (in Amps)
  - "t1": List of temperature readings (in Â°C, can have multiple values) (5 records)

Example of that list is `sample_data` and `sample_data2` in code.
After creating your list, edit the `data_in_use` variable to use the list you created, replacing `sample_data` on line 25 of the script
